# Ollama Smart Proxy Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. OOP
All code must follow object-oriented programming principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism where appropriate. This ensures maintainable and extensible software architecture.

### II. DRY
Don't Repeat Yourself: Eliminate code duplication by abstracting common functionality into reusable components. This promotes consistency and reduces maintenance overhead.

### III. KISS
Keep It Simple Stupid: Prefer simple solutions over complex ones. Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions to maintain code clarity and ease of understanding.

## Additional Constraints

TODO(SECTION_2_CONTENT): Define technology stack requirements, compliance standards, deployment policies, etc.

## Development Workflow

TODO(SECTION_3_CONTENT): Define code review requirements, testing gates, deployment approval process, etc.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. Versioning follows semantic versioning: MAJOR for backward incompatible changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for fixes. Compliance must be verified in all PRs/reviews.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Original adoption date unknown | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-30
